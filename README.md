This repository is the API data for my other repository named Getgo as part of our team project for our CS385 Mobile Applications Development module in my Software Development Higher Diploma. Data was created using https://www.mockaroo.com/ and merged with a list of all Irish towns and cities to create a ride-share from any inputted town or city name.
